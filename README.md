# NASA-Asteroid-Data-Analysis-Project
This project was developed as part of the Programming and Data Analysis in Python course.
It involves loading, processing, and analyzing NASA asteroid data using various Python libraries.

## Features
- Load data from a CSV file
- Scope and mask data
- Compute statistics such as max absolute magnitude and closest asteroid to Earth
- Visualize data using histograms, pie charts, and scatter plots with linear regression

## Libraries Used
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- SciPy

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/Barabramov/NASA-Asteroid-Data-Analysis1.git`
2. Ensure you have Python installed.
3. Install the required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run the script using the command: `python nasa_asteroid_ds.py`.

## Project Structure
- `project_script.py`: Main script with all functions and analysis
- `nasa.csv`: Example dataset

## Visualizations  
Below are some visualizations generated from the analyzed NASA asteroid data:  

### Histogram of Asteroids by Minimum Orbit Intersection  
This histogram shows the distribution of asteroids based on their minimum orbit intersection distance with Earth.
